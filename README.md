Tick Tock

## The visionâ„¢
I am a friendly discord.py bot.

I'm a utility for your forum channel needs, gone are the days where (c)lose or (lock) are insufficient for forum posts.

A wise developer once said:
> Close is useless, anyone even adding a reaction will reopen the post.
> 
> While lock is too strong, people can't add reactions.

Discord's just a bit shit like that, I get it.

Oh! I'm also a utility to make sure you get to bed on time.
